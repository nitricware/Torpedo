# Torpedo

Torpedo is a tiny javascript game that puts you in the position of a tactical commander in an underwater base.

ALERT - Multiple hostile submarines are approaching. Adjust your torpedo canon to hit the undersea boats and hit the fire button.

One torpedo can hit multiple targets. The more targets a single torpedo hits the higher your score gets.

## Technical Details

*Torpedo* uses plain javascript - no jQuery or similar needed.

## Todo

- Graphical enhancements
- Actual consequences if the submarines are too close
- Box art image
